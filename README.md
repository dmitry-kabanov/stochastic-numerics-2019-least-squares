# Robust Least Squares methods

## Description

This repository contains codes and presentation for my reading of the Chapter 8
of the book by Sivia and Stelling *"Data Analysis: a Bayesian Tutorial"*, OUP Oxford, 2006.

This chapter considers extensions of the ordinary least-squares algorithm to improve robustness. Namely, how to fit a model to observational data when they
can be outliers.

Presentation was prepared for the class Stochastic Numerics in RWTH Aachen,
Spring 2019 semester.

## Requirements

The code requirements:

* [python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7
* [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) 1.15
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) 1.1
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 3.0

Python distribution [Anaconda](anaconda.com) version 2018.12 was actually used
to obtain the above stack.

Beamer presentation was prepared using [TexLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
2018.
